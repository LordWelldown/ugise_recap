"i got a three, no treasure for me" - Aro
 Allamir listening at the door to the big room, no big sounds

side room, fireplace and nothing worth mentioning. it connects to a kitchen and
also nothing useful.

"Spiders love wok" - Aro

Dia puts on a pan... on her back... for turle stuff

Dwarves think too much, go open the big room door. A stench punches them in the
face, dozens of dead ghouls.

as we continue the sweep, we come across a smithy room with some useful tools,
although a bit rusty

dia hears some sounds in a chimney. she throws some spare coals int he furnace
and attemts to burn them out. 2 stirges fly out.
