# Session 16 #

## Recap ##

we still in action, in Axehome

## Vaatus 2 ##

East side of the room is collapsed. Lookes like a shrine, carvings on the wall,
ceiling looks fragile at some spots.
There are stairs up.

The murals
some evilish rituals depicted, dwarves with shields, symbol [[Abbathor]].
there is a village burning,
dwarves going towards it.

Orik dismisses the Centaur and summons another illusion. Stone Golem, Rock.

We go up the stairs. A skitter sound. orik shoots a bolt, sees some cloth???

some weird words, threat: "if you want to live, leave"

we find 2 sleepy ghouls in a room, quickly dispose of them.

orik does blackface in a chimney hole.

this looks to be a bath room, there is a bath hole and bones and a skull in it,
seemingly human.

Pervert ghost looks at us through the ceiling, warns us again.

Ceiling gave BIRTH?!?!?!
its a pair rusty-orange oozes, with extra bone.

dia goes to a side room, partially collapsed at one corner.
Orik hears a deeb growl behind the double doors in the room.
Dia finds a skeleton in the rubble and a small potion vial, with a sweet smell.
Dia tastes a bit of it, heals 1 hp (Superior Healing Potion)

Dwarves are arguing, dia sneaks throught the door
**Bouillon**  shennanigan

Back in the hallway, next room, abandoned bed with curtains
something is floating in the air, a humanish whisper
Orik walks in, satrts talking to the ghost a bit
