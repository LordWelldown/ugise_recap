# Session 18 #

## Going back with demoted person ##

Pete is dragging Oriks DEAD FUCKING BODY behind and they go home in silence and conteplation.
As a plan, they bang together a death bed from planks and go to Adabra in the morning.

"There is sadness in our eyes, loss in our heart." Allamir being 'serious sad'.

Adabra offers a space a place in the Umbrige Hill, where other dwarves were buried.

They arrange a burial thing.

## Celebration of life and death ##

2 days later, Funeral time. Towns people come to participate:
Barthen, other people, no Harbin. Father Gabriel does a small prayer.

Allamir speaks some words, like a a gay boy he is. Speaking of the dragon and
dissing Harbin. Shit turn political. He sets the Mimic Dagger #1 in his grave
and summons a sad, flaccid Tentacle.

Dia sets a wooden carved anvil in oriks coffin.

Pete does a traditional Dwarven Torch Funeral shout, ROCK AND STONE!

Orik is laid to rest in a stone, with his hammer for a headstone.

Beer to *buillion* for Pete, Allamir is drinking and talking shit about Harbin,
Dia is listening to Allamir.

At some point Allamir come to talk with Grim, they set up a meeting in the morning.

## Business time ##

Dia wakes up in a tree with a hangover.
Grim meets with the gang, make a plan to go to Falcon and deal with orcs.

While others finish up business and stuff, Grim goes to pick up horses from Leilon.

peeps level up:

* Pete looks at his axe
* Allamir does business
* Dia kills boulders and goes super sayan

Grim buying horses. Volvo, Bolt, Ãœber Pferd, Fudy

We travel to Falcon and rest for the night in the forest.
