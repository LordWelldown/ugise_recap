Day time, Night Time!

Allamir distracts
Legendary draw, illusory golem
orcs sound the alarm, and Allamir starts blasting

3 giant rats, 2 cause chaos, one is sniffy
we run in with scent searching rats and get most of the way in
Pete runs into a big orc, who is surprisingly perceptive
Pete gets a hit

Back to allamir
orks getting blasted and asses clapped by tentacle

Dia gets in the tent
muskle plays defence the old fashioned way, with violence
dia fails to open the cages
grim flings acid from the alchemy jug,
pete does violence

allamir retreats a misty step, blasts nicely
orcs dying, good blasting
big chief arrives, does a growl, like a proper lady
a big dude arrives,

orks around allamir turn and run back
allamir thunderclaps or something
repositions to 

we hear the clap, "we need to go"
the big dude demands to know what is happening

"why are you here"
"we came to take fred. also, fireball"
