# Recap {#recap} #

## Session 1 \- 6\. mai {#session-1---6.-mai} ##

me oleme phandalinis, there have been sightings of a white dragon

Harbin Wester \- town master, ta ei k√§i v√§ga tihti v√§ljas 

teadetetahvlil on 3 teadet (pluss meie t√∂√∂tajate otsingu leht):

1. magic gnomes might have stuff, if you dont want it , harbin is offering 50 gp  
1. dwarves southeast dont know about the dragon threat, go give them the news  
1. local midwife

the party meets and sets up a contract (no dental, no health insurance. payment and danger go 50-50)

Orik  
Allamir  
Dianth  
Pete

The long folk go shopping for rations. \[aro tegelane\] makes a tentacle joke, ‚Äúim going to milk the tentacles‚Äù

dazzlyn grayshard, norbus ironrune \- business partners and dwarves.

theres a temple in the destroyed village, 2 kuju on templi uste k√µrval (cloaked dwarves with an evil smile)

we drink a glass of ale for the fallen and go in to take care of some oozes

OOh, a sneaky ceiling slime.

we kill the slimes and start investigating the temple room. we find 2 secret doors that we fail to open the doors. Dianthe finds a dwarf skeleton and gems in a pillar.

theres are 2 statues in the room. on of them exploded and the other has a big green gem in its hand. Orik uses Catapult spell to get the gem free from the statue (statue explodes). a bit later the gem disintegrates (sad)

as we start to leave, we hear some orc noises. we manage to hide and the dragon comes down, kills the orcs and eats most of them. After investigating the frozen orcs, they seem malnourished.

We get back to Phandalin and split the gems and money. big money for the forge fund.  
next day we invest the forge fund into buying an anvil and some charcoal for the forge (5 days)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    .  
meanwhile the long folk get gold from harthen and he suggest we urge her to return to Phandalin.

we get no soothies from the Miner‚Äôs Exchange.

Umbrage hill is our next destination. as we reach the windmill, we see a manticore at the door. Adabra is asking for help. We manage to make a trade with the manticore, 4 days of rations and the location of the orcs if it promises 

Adabra, the dwarven midwife, is very reluctant te the idea of leaving the gravestones and coming to town, saying that the dragon is more likely to attack a bigger settlement. Dianthe manages to finally convince her to go to town.

The graves (history check) are from a fight between two clans of dwarves. Orik and Pete pay their respects by pouring out some ale and taking a drink.

Allamir finds a blade in a mound. after asking Adabra, who says that the blade is most likely an offering and not a part of the grave. we decide not to take the blade and instead hide it more.

Adabra gets the house next to Harbin and is offering us a discount for potions.

the next morning we are woken up by a dragonattack. the dragon steals a horse and does a cool drive by at us. Orik dodges the blast, the others get blasted. Allamir and Dianthe drop, but survive.

we rest for the day and we level up, yay

## Session 2 \- 20\. juuni {#session-2---20.-juuni}

We do a quick lvl up montage: Allamir shoots grass and gathers info, Pete recklessly attacks lumber, Orik tinkers, Dianthe does push ups and attacks the wood

Allamir gathers some info, we have a discussion about the next mission(manticore problem, orcs, gnomes). we agree with the gnomes.

J√µuame Gnomengarde-i. siin on v√§ike oja ja kedagipole n√§ha. me h√º√ºame, kuid ei saa vastuseid, ning l√µpuks l√§heme √ºhte koopasse sisse. seal on gnoomid, teevad toite seentest. meid juhatakse edasi j√§rgmiste gnoomide juurde, dabbledob and fibblestib. k√µnnime koopas edasi ja n√§eme gnomide t√µstukeid.

j√§rmises ruumis on mingi t√ºnnidest tehtud ambudega kaitsemasin, √ºks gnoom, Factoria                                                                                                                   on seal peal ja h√§das sellega. we go into initiative

Orik viskab k√∂ie √ºle √ºhe ammu, pete aitab t√µmmata, allamir ai saa gnoomi maha (hakkab vastu), dianthe l√§heb tooma t√µstukit (‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back‚Äù)

we crack the barrels witht the crab lifters (dianthe), fuse a few gears (oirk), pull one off (pete) and slap the last into pieces (allamirs tentacle)

edasi liikudes kahtlustatakse meid kujumuutujateks olemises, kuid me veename neid piisavalt et edasi minna. √ºle silla ja j√§rgmisesruumis on 2 tiivikut, teravad ja ohtlikud. Allamiri tentakle mage hand t√µmbab kangi ja l√ºlitab selle v√§lja.

dabbledob ja fibblestib arutavad kumb amaagilise asja peaksid nad tegema. sanity ray or straight jacket. the 2 (\!\!\!) kings, Korbos (coo-coo) and Gnerkly.  one of them has apparently gone a bit insane. nad paluvad et me neid aitaks neid ja ei tapaks neid √§ra.

j√µuame nende ukse taha, orik koputab. ‚Äúhello, were not king killers‚Äù

Kuningast r√ºndas vaip ja ta n√§gi kuidas √ºks uks gnoomi √§ra s√µi. we do a round of investigations, *detect magic*  ja k√ºsimused. no useful information gained.  
we go talk to korbos again. tleb v√§lja et Gnerklyl on suu kinni pandud aga ta √ºtleb et ta on fine. we talk some more, ask how and why Korbos thinks theres a shape changer.

theres a yell back in the caves, jookseme tagasi. Factoria, the barrel gnome, √ºtleb et √ºks lamp jooksis minema. fe follow it in a room of barrels and one of the gnomes says that there should be 11 barrels, but theres 12\!\!\!. we narrow the options down with reckless abandon (agressive pokes with a spear) and we find the mimic. Initiative\!\!

allamir gets slapped with a tentacle (the irony), Dianthe burns all the barrels, pete does an angry attack, allamir summons his own tentacle (fight fire with fire?). it poofs into smoke and ninjas away üòÆ

finally, we find that it might be in the treasury room, we get fibblestib (USELESS gnome) and ask if he notices that there is anything out of the ordinary. ‚ÄúFOCUS Fibblestib, FOCUS\!\!\!‚Äù

One of the chests is a bit smokier, ITS THE MIMIC. Initiative\!\! 

Pete misses his swing, Dianthe bolts some fire, Orik is unimaginative and bolts some fire, Allamir just blasts and decapitates (?) the chest

We get the news to the king, he opens the door and releases his bf. We get some magic items in reward:

* Wind fan  
* Cape of the mountebank  
* clockwork amulet  
* pole of collapsing  
* hat of wizardry  
* bag of holding  
* bag of trick (gray)  
* deck of illusions

we socialice witht he gnomes and lvl up

## Session 3 \- 15\. juuli {#session-3---15.-juuli}

we eat the gnomes (breakfast) and we get some rations and wine as gifts. siis t√µmbame nahhui. n√§eme feel draakonit √ºle pea lendamas, umbes phandalini poole.

Asulasse j√µudes, it is fine. inimesed panevad aga √ºlesse kevadfestivali, mis toimub 2 p√§eva p√§rast.   
harbin is being a paranoid pussy, slips the gold to us form under the table. mst of the gold goes to the forge fund.

downtime:

* Orik does tinkering in the forge, armor plates, tinkering for a show.  
* Allamir goes gathering info, kuulab mis rahvas r√§√§gib:   
  * west of phandalin, theres a old stone lighthouse, ships are drawn, they die, maybe treasure ?  
* pete helps me  
* dianthe helps the people with the preparations, allamir joins with his tentacle-hands (‚Äúticking childre‚Äù)  
* we decide to stay for the festival

downtime 2:

* forging armor for myself (chainmail)  
* cooking stew for the next day  
* others help with preparations

it is Feyday. Orik has a stew stall, with a small automaton, Stewie, that serves the stew. (stewie‚Äôs made out of spoons and forks). we join the barrel roll competiton (‚Äúbarrel roll champion of 1999‚Äù).

* pete falls a couple of times, he a bit drunk  
* orik has trouble with the barrels (‚Äúthese are not regulation Barrel Roll barrels‚Äù)  
* dianthe is on a roll (kek)  
* allamir is also having trouble after a strong start  
* i jinxed dianthe, ta on 5 kaugusel l√µpust ja veeretab alla kolme

arrows: allamir wins with 2 bullseyes, dianthe hits an actual bulls eye (not really)  
log chopping: pete destroys the log

in the morning, theres a scream. a boy has been attacked (dwarves are asleeb still), he says that their farm has been attacked by orcs. Al Kalazorn is the own.

we rent horses to go to help Al, yes, they are asking money for that. we get 2 horses and head that way. Dianthe teab, et coniberry on maha j√§etud. tee peal n√§eme hobuseid, we bring them with.

Conberrys on √ºks lehm, j√§tame √ºleliigsed hobused sinna. Allamir m√§rkab l√§hedal olevas tornis kedagi, l√§hemale minnes he gets hit by an arrow.  
we reache the shrine walls and see many dig holes (dick holes) inside. 

we move inside the walls. as we get closer to the tower, that shot at us, another arrow flies at Pete, DANGER SENSE, ACTIVATE\!\!\! it is fight time, initiative.

Orik runs up, shoots a fire bolt and shields up, dorc (the d is silent) runs to him and misses like a bitch. Dianthe shoots another bolt at him and Pete tries to hit too. Allamir doesnt want to be left put and also wails on the dorc with a blast and a tentacle.   
More orcs appear from behind, one at allamir, one at dianthe. Orik runs to Dianthe and fists the dorc with thunder, after which dianthe crisps the orc to a snack. Pete attacks recklessly, maybe a bit too recklessly, and misses. allamair tentacles the alive orc.  
An ogre joins the fight, we take out the lone orc. Orik √§ssitab Pete‚Äôi ogre peale ja laseb magick missles the orc and pete reenacts gimly and orc in the mines of moria and and allamir misty steps away from the friendly ogre. tower orc is annoying with their arrows.   
Oric catapults a rock through the orcs head, Dianthe shoots a crit acid ball at the ogre and messes it up big time. Pete finishes the job, head‚Äôs-a-flying.

Dianthe loots the bodies and grabs the shitty weapons. Orik finds a magic source, in the shrine. one of the doors in the shrine are stuck, orik and dianthe burn the door down.

Orik touches the altar and after a minute has an out of body experience, flies out of his body, south east into the mountains, a fort with a sleepy dragon on the roof.

on the altar is written:   
1 .May your riches be safe, ringing high in heavens.  
2\. high toward heaven, riches gathered together, secret safe secure.

(PROBABLY NOT IMPORTANT\!\!\!\!\!\!)

57 gp, mystery key

we decide to do a long rest here.

## Session 4 \- 1\. august {#session-4---1.-august}

we sleep, we hear dragon. (RIDDLE IS THE BELL?)

we leave ost of the zoo behind meaning to return and we move forward

j√µuame farmini. something is on fire at a lake.

we decide to sneak throughthe corn (mmmm, corn) and spook a pig.

Smithi is burned town, a pile of bodies burning. several (3-4) orcs are next to and there is a pile of raw bodies and bodieparts. pete and orik start rushing towards the shits

INITIATIVE:

s  
Pete rages out from the corn rushes an orc  
Dianthe firebolts a mf, 8/10, clean shot, room for improvement  
   
Orik runs up, shields and blasts a thunderwave to a pair of orcs, human bodyparts flying from and inviting more people to the party

orik and pete get hit by javelins  
pete slices a orc to death  
dianthe cans the ol‚Äô reliable, firebolt  
allamir eldriches a guy  
Orik runs at a new orc, smashes the ribs medium rare and spits in the bastards face  
the green shit tries to hit back, but orik does not consent

dianthe throws a big shot from downtown and thunders one of the skinhead  
one of the orcs gets a hit on allamir,

orik grasps an orcs stomach and gives him a nice shoker, then does a tactical retreat  
pete gets javelined

we eat all the orcs and theres another one in the house. we kill it swiftly. another one is in THE SHITTER. Orik rushes (i wish i could blow it up) and summons a Frost Lynx illusion.  
A chef orc comes out and promptly gets attacked by Pete, but dodges. Pete gets axed in return.

orik knocks on the shitter door and calls the greenskin out. meanwhile the chef gets cooked.  
the orc leaves the shitter, promptly gets hammered to the chest and touched inappropriately by Diathes chill touch and proceed turns into an Ex orc.  
End of initiative

Dianthe scoops the house and find cooked horse meat and \[insert shit here\], as the others are cutting orc tounges.  
As Dianthe goes to the second floor, he gets attack by a sneaky orc. a duel ensues, blows are exchanged and the duel turns into kerfuffle as more orcs join and Dianthe exits stage left.

INITATIVE:

one of the orcs goes for dianthe and another. another few blows, one of the orcs gets downed. one of the orcs gets a good hit on orik and almost dropping him. the gang comes to help and sweeps the floor and gains a cowboy hat.  
end of initiative

we clear the upper floor swat style and there is a wounded and immediately ded orc as 3 attacks come at it.

Allamir finds gold, Dianthe finds a Mithril Chain-mail. we also check the cellar and there is a human there, tied to a chair and head sacked. we carry him to bed and treat him.

allamir goes out and Fans away the flames.

short rest

The dead guy is alive and he‚Äôs Al. orcs came and attacked the farmstead. they tried to defend. He‚Äôs happy we find his cow and asks us to escort him to phandalind with the animals. (pigs, horses and chickens) he gives us a reward.

on our way back, we grab the bell from the shrine (3 feet wide and 50 pounds ?\!?\!?\!?) and reach phandalin safe.

## Session 5 \- 17\. september {#session-5---17.-september}

we start the game by harassing harbin for a home for Al. Harbin actually lets us in so we could put Al in a bed and he said he‚Äôd take care of him. harbin the fat piece of shit doesnt want the tounges and tusks we gathered and Dianthe pushes us out before we traumatize him any more.

HORSE DESCRIPTION:

Lightning: looks like a casual horse, buff, workhorse  
Thunder: must valgete triipudega k√ºljel

Viime √§ra keeled. K√µrtsmikule ei meeldinud v√§ga, et me need letile panime ja juhtab meid nurka, kus on mees valvuritega. so we slap the tounges on his table.  
we start drinking with our newfound gold and some time later allamir join.

morning. we eat eggs and discuss quests

first we go to barthens to discuss the supply run for a logging camp in the Neverwinter Forrest. seems quite straight forward.  
we also check out don-jon raskin in the inn. hes a middle aged man nad has a crocodile hunter hat. he says hes not in a hurry but needs an escort into the mountan. that looks like we are going to do escort before the supply.

we get a few extra horses and go towards the mine. on the way there we find some orc bodies (free tounges). cause of death unknown to us.

arriving at the mine, we see a bunch of dwarf graves. might be trouble.  
we go in the mines and get stopped by wererats.  
‚Äúthis place is ruled by the whisker gang‚Äù. we ask to be taken to their leader. we also notice a crude map on the wall, 3 entrances (west, east, southeast) and a skull in the north side of the caves.

talking with the rat king, we do not manage far with diplomacy. orik tries one more time, with intimidation, to make them leave. they dont take the hind and the dwarves charge.

‚ÄúI sense danger, but not for me‚Äù

INITIATIVE:

Orik thunderwaves the biches into a wall and the head rat strikes back a bit.  
Dianthe burns, pete slashes and allamir tentacles.   
during the fight, orik gets cursed by a wererat  
fight is long  
the reinforcements arrive  
the final wererat dies with a firebolt to the eye.

15 days  
450 cp, 12 sp, pair of goggles in a sack  
the bodies turn back into humans and dwarves

we do a short rest and finish for today

## Session 6 \- 22\. oktoober {#session-6---22.-oktoober}

We have rested and we do some looting. dwarves are keeping watch  
we hear sound from the deeper in the caves.

as were going deeper in the cave we come across a door in a narrow path. we try to be sneaky, as we hear sound near in another path, but we are detected and attacked by giant rats. we are kind of trapped.

INITIATIVE:  
Dianthe gets rushed by a rat that hits the wall (what a loser)  
Orik fails to pick the lock on the door  
Some tentacle action occurs  
Pete deletes a rat with a crit  
Orik is worse than Joe biden and cant open the door.  
The 3 round we allare shit and the last rat gets a haircut.  
Orik manages to open the door. there are 2 dwarves with readied ‚Äúweapons‚Äù  
Tentacle kills the last rat

the dwarves dont like the rat meat we offer. Dianthe gives them actual food.

We decided to barricate ourselves in the room with the dwarves and take a long rest. during the rest i tell the other of my ware rat disease. 

GOOD MORNING

we go back to one of the crossroads and explore the path. we approach a door on the side of the path and Dianthe just walzes in and starts blasting. theres 3 wererats in the room

INITATIVE:  
Pete rages and swings.  
diatnhe shoots and ages (wild surge).  
Orik rolls and bolts fire.  
Allamir hexes and blasts.

after the fight we continue and clear the caves, there are no more wererats. on the last cave diathe gets dropped on by a carrion crawler. we start hitting the maggot and dispatch it without much trouble

Dianthe finds a maybe cursed coin in the crawler that keeps reappearing in her hand after a moment. 

we report back to Jon bon Jovi and return to phandlin with our stuff and loot

In Phandalin dianthe and I investigate the coin. Allamir checks the notice board and gets our payment from Harbin. 

we sleep and we LEVEL UP\!

## Session 7 \- 19.november {#session-7---19.november}

Wolf update: 13 p√§eva

Orik goes looking for a cleric/holy man  
Allamir goes looking for notifications

loggers camp is still there, used but returned.  
stolen chinkens on the board???

Orik goes to church. he gets a sensual massage(?), oh no, he grabs my shoulders. Father Gabriel isnt powerful enough

allamir and gang go rumour shopping to the inn. 

strategy about the dragon: buy/builda ballista for roping it down and hold it down. the shady, tongue buyers actually know how to shoot a ballista.

we decide to take the logging camp supply job. we stock up on rations   
listo f supply shit:

* food stuff, 2 crates  
* Flask of oil

we need to bring the wagon and ox Vincent back

adabra says she needs claws, eyes and hair/tooth from the rats to brew a ‚Äòantidote‚Äô for the curse.

allamir manages to seduce us a discount

we split the party and we start moving. Dianthe goes back to the toe of the mountain to get some wererat parts as we start traveling with the supplies.

Orik is working on a ballista 

\[something happens here with Dianthe in the mountain\]. she gets the ingredients and she tries to steal Bon Jovis hat before she leaves. she double times back to phandalin and then to us, without sleeping and resting.

we reach the forrest and in a clearing we spot a suspicious boar, just standing there, menacingly. Allamir tries to hunt it but misses. the boar had weird vibes.

we push trough into the night to find a wooden palisment, a small fort belonging to (presumably) falcon called Falcon‚Äôs Hunting Lodge. we are let in by Corwin (Ramsey), cook (thank you, chief).

we are guid into the common room/dining room with hunting lodge vibes, orc and aimal trophies on the walls. Falcon, who looks like a hunter, comes and greets us. he looks handsome, blue eyes (HINT, MOTHERFUCKERS).  
we exchange pleasantries and gifts and make small talk. he says that there are some orcs in the forrest making trouble, they have some stick creatures. there are also some ruins, but Falcon doesn‚Äôt really know where those are. He promised to search for it if we deal with the orcs and smoke thing

dianthe calls for allamir ‚Äúhey, wet boy‚Äù and gives him Bon Jovi‚Äôs hat. Moisty shows her peter dancing again and she falls asleep listening to gnome noises.

we wake to the sound of cocks and soon start moving forward.

The camp is in reach, but the place is quiet. we see noone and the campfires are extinguished. orik goes for a closer look, an ankheg burrows out and attacks. ROCK AND STONE, BITCH\!\!\!

INITIATIVE:  
ankheg gets a surprise attack and spits at orik and dianthe. honestly, rude  
Allamir hexesthe ugly bug  
Pete gets angry and gets angry again, starts hacking and the ankheg grabs him into a tight embrace  
dianthe ray of frosts it  
orik runs and tries to punch the bug  
**\!\! BUG ALERT \!\!** another bug appearst  
pete recklessly attacks twice and CRITs, the bug is dead  
Diathe uses her clay hand and cast maximilian‚Äôs earthen grasp  
Orik shoots a fire bolt into its face  
allamir dispatches the bug  
pete tires to retrieve his axe,  
**\!\! BUG ALERT 2: electrig boogaloo \!\!** another bug appears and pete angrily hits it  
dia moves his hand  
magic missiles hit its face from Orik  
allamir again kills this bug

tents are empty but not bloody. but there are signs of trouble. a fight has happened, yby the markins it looks like someone has been pulled underground.

we go to the house and Orik shouts, there is a quiet ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù and allamir hears a hint to duck. a bug fist comes from the door and almost hits orik. back into

INITIATIVE:  
pete goes and hits the door  
other fight too (i was looking for my dice), good damage to the bug  
Orik hits it with his hammer and actually does damage this time.  
ELDRITCH BLAST

Tibor, Harbin‚Äôs brother throws a molly in the wooden house‚Ä¶ extremely big brain move. he gets scared to get out of the house because of the bugs. Dianthe manages to convince him and we start extinguishing the fire. Allamir guidances pete and, for our entertainment, conjures an illusion of pete dancing again.

allamir summons a few owls too scout the forest. he finds what could be dragging tracks.  
we decide to check it out and do a short rest

Allamir connects the dots, the bugs are going to the same approximate direction that Falcon said that the Orcs with their Twinks are. we decide to drop Tibor off at falcons and check it out ourselves. we long rest and go to Falcons (11 days, 10 days if we start in the morning)

Me j√§tame Tibori magama ja otsime √ºles Falconi. He has seen smoke from the.

Me otsustame minna p√µhja suunas, sest sealt tulevat musta suitsu, probably orcs. peame √ºletama j√µge ja otsustame silla kasuks. sad sad, sild on katki. Orik ja Allamir ehitavad √ºle silla sellise k√µiss√µiduki ja saame k√µik ilusti √ºle. me avastame et sild on meelega katki tehtud.

Me kuuleme metsas j√§rsku vaikust ja Dianthe ainukesene m√§rkab siniseid silmasid meid j√§lgimas (maybe Falcon)

Dianthe arvab et see ei ole normaalne. Me j√§litame natuke seda siga, kes meid j√§lgib. J√§rsku lendab meie poole odad, meil √µnnestub reagerida ja sea asemel on j√§rsku mingi veider, stronk looking guy, definetly deadlifts 150kg

INITATIVE:

we are posturing, they try to intimidate us, everyone is getting into position. Orik realizes that they are not in a talkative mood.

Pete‚Äôs new friend spells him with thunder/lightning and repositions  
Allamir tries to follow the guy  
Dianthe‚Ä¶

we win and collect the tongues. we also rest a bit.  
Me liigume edasi ja j√µuame mingi majani. it looks lowerclass. suddenly, Pete gets dropped on by a Twink (twig creature). Allamir blasts it and it to kindling. we notice 3 other twinks.

Dianthe calls a weasel  
allamir blasts nothing  
pete helps orik  
twinks fall and attack  
orik fists a twink  
diathe burns a twink  
allamir whispers a twink to death

we investigate the house, seal vb on keegi sees. Uksel on mitu nuppu ja Orik v√µtab √ºhest suvalisest kinni, gets Frost damage (nob was bluish). Other nobs are colored like  different elements.  
Allamir notices a nob with a face and it apparently can speak. The house belongs to a wizard, Mister F. He doesnt let us in. allamir finds a invisible knob. Orik jerks the knob, bribes it with piece of jerky, it actually opens.  
Orik doesnt want to step in. Dianthe does ja √ºle l√§ve astudes h√§√§led muutuvad, h√§√§l ei levi l√§bi ukse. there is a basic living rooom, a bit dusty with a fireplace and a bookshelf. We hear steps. someone comes down ja korraks tuleb nurga tagant v√§lja. small hooded figure, it‚Äôs scared. it calls another person, it questions us and says its dangerous. finally, mister F appears. we try to talk to him, but he‚Äôs being antagonistic. Mentioning killing the twinks he turns agressive. even worse wth the orcs we killed, he attacks us.

INITATIVE:  
THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE  
Allamir casts Gust of Wind, blows most of the fire away, cant go through the door  
Orik gets firebolted, he absorbs it fully,  
another dude FIREBALLS the room,  
dianthe tries to calm the situation  
Pete attacks the door, doesn‚Äôt work  
Orik grabs a child, it gets away and runs

dianthe and Pete follow them, but get duped by a secret door, they come back upstairs and attacks us again.  
dianthe finds some info  
pete is doing cardio XD

so finally, parley. we almost fail the deescalation. 

so, tense, tense. we try to escape, get the fuck out of there. nad on n√µus ust avama, p√§rast veenmist. he starts casting a spell. dianthe steps out at the last moment  
we get teleported out, dianthe stays behind.  
Session ends‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶???

## Session 9 \- 3.03.2024 {#session-9---3.03.2024}

We land form the teleportation, in a winter wonderland‚Ä¶  
immediately other dudes get teleported on us:  
a half beaten, half dead, half elf. Looks a bit sickly and wearing a suit and glasses  
half elf, looks annoyed and light armor  
heavily armored dragonborn with a shield and mace, black robes that lands on Orik

its tense, but we have bigger problems now, the weather is snow.  
were on a cliffside path, mountain one side, cliff on the other. the snowstorm covers most of the view. we head down the road, Xanthar leading the way

the storm and wind is strong and some of us get almost blown off. Orik v√µtab oma n√∂√∂ri ja seob k√µik omavahel kinni, et me ei kukkuks liiga lihtsalt.

edasi liikudes l√µuame kitsale kohale, kus osa teest on alla kukkunud. poolhaldjad peaaegu kukuvad surnuks, aga bande ja Xanthar aga suudavad n√∂√∂ri abil nad tagasi t√µmmata.

We hear a sound and some see a hairy flying beast through the storm. (ITS APPA\!\!)  
We see a snow camel. Allamir tries to BLAST a camel, but misses. we follow, but lose them

we‚Äôre getting tired, slowing down. Oscar drops down from exhaustion. Dwarves start to argue and Xanthar takes Oscar in a carry. He wants to fall down

We finally find a cave, but it might be occupied. there were dragging trails and some blood.

the front two, Xanthar and Pete, hear some munching noises. they eating some weasel and a limb

we see 2 kitties, but big.

INITIATIVE:  
the cats are not happy. they pounce on the frontline, knocking down pete and Xanthar and they bite, xanthar manages to block.  
Pete smashes a cat and properly hurts one of them, xanthar misses.  
Orik cast Thunderwave, one of them gets flattened against the cave wall, the other pushed away.  
‚Ä¶  
there are 2 more cats. xanthar spells, pete javelins. orik fists and allamir tentacles.   
pete dispatches one of the cats and allamir and orik 

we clear the cave and find some remains of a camper. we spend the night and heal up, share adventure stories.

morning, orik gets a message to dianthe asking is she ok, and that we are stuck in a blizzard, but alive for now. Shes answers that shes dealt with the wizard and is looking a way to help us with Jenna(?).

as we travel, pete falls into a hole, that has standing skeletons in it. we get him out with a rope after some tries.

we go forward towards the smoke that we saw in the morning, its a small cottage. as Xanthar approaches to knock, we get [teleport circled out](https://i.imgflip.com/4e7lyu.jpg) into a cave full of zombies. they seem nice, if not a bit gross.

theres a door with symbols on it and we can connect the symbols. we try some combinations and finally we draw  a star and the door opens. 

we see 2 hallways. and a door with even more symbols. Allamir solves it and immediatley nopes the door closed again: skeletons, the same ones as before.

we explore the rest of the cave and see a blob in a circular room. and we hear clinks. there are 2 minotaurs, one of them looks a bit off. a head gets beheaded and the surviving minotaur charges at us

INITIATIVE:  
SURPIRSE; theres a 3rd one, alivetoo. alive is a strong word tho, it looks undead (ribcage open, a bit jucky)  
it rushes orik, attacks. ouch  
orik punches the mino, hand gets stuck.  
Vinadir tries to tie it down.  
pete whiffs his attack.  
Xanthar finally does some danage.  
tentacle comes out and blast does blast.  
Pete gets axed and orik zaps and fails to get his hand loose  
vidadir SNEAK ATTACK   
pete misses again  
oscar burning hands the lungs  
xanthar calls his friend, its a flaming sphere. it kicks the minotaur and fires it.   
allamir attacks the last mino.  
orik runs to the last mino and CRITS its ass off.  
vinadir slices it and kills it.

further in the cave we see some skeletons mining and a guy looking at their work. he as bone armor. we move closer and allamir tries to talk. dude creepily turns his head and allamir takes that as a que to start blasting. (dude looks fake and dead)

INITIATIVE:  
xanatar guiding bolts and pete misses his jav  
Oscar ‚Ä¶ vinadir throws a dagger, does a little damage  
orik firebolts a skele and allamir combos the Guy  
skeletons come and suck ass  
we blast it some more and finally kill it

‚Äúwhy‚Äù it says as he dies his final death  
another dorr, with gems. there are 4 different and Viradir OPEN-s it

next room. there are levers and a clock???? levers dont seem to do anything and the clock runs uotu. we get teleported, safely into a small room, not in a cave anymore.  
the door opens and ‚Äúcome in, i know youre there‚Äù

there is a  person, hooded figure, slim build. His name is Elroth.   
The cave is a failed experiment storage for him, hes actually nice

he can teleport us back to dianthe and others back to their realm. he needs a item to connects us back and a donation of 50gp. allamir manages to sell him the skull butter with a NAT 20 *gnome noises*

## Session 10 \- 31.03.2024 {#session-10---31.03.2024}

7,5 days left until the Full Moon.

Dia is in the house. sending stone starts vibrating and a circle teleportation circle appears. The dudes appear  
the room looks a bit burned, Mister F is tied up and sockked. Apprentices is carrying a platter of tea. there is a Elf here, called Jenna

we decide to go back to Falcons, to deliver the socked teleporter and maybe go to the ruins later.  
Orik gets a knob  
 we come across the broken bridge again. we brainstorm some plans. we get to the plan of Dianthe Dimension doorig over with the Sock-wizard, Allamir Thundersteps with the child and the rest go ever like we did before, magic rope bridge.  
We arrive at Falcons in the evening.

Falcon is busy atm with some guests, we take some food and drink to wait. Orik investigates the knob, it eats half of the peanuts form a bowl. Tibor is sad about losing his business (he burned it down himself).  
Falcon comes to us and tells he knows that the ruins are from and old wizard. He had a mansion, wizard disappeared years ago.  we decide to leave it for now and head back to Phandlin with Tibor. He is blackout drunk and we get him to bed. we could maybe use him as an accountant.

Morning arrives, we prepare to move. 7 days left. Ox cart gets 2 dwarves and Tibor. Falcon also prepares to move. 

We move in a reasonable pace and reache the edge of the forrest before evening and make camp. tibor gets a proposition of managing our forge business

NIght comes and there are some sounds. Allamir and Pete dont see anything but Orik manages to see that they are some weird hogs. he climbs on the cart to wait for their return, jumps on one of the 3 hogs and fails to ride it. but it is tied to his rope and the cart. a sudden thunderwave comes. its magic orcs

INITIATIVE:  
Orik yells and alarm, armor shields and tries to attack twice, but misses, TWICE  
Orc misses back  
Allamir and Dianthe get lightning bolted by the orc2.  
Dianthe CRITS with Chromatic Orb, 41 acid damage\!\!  
stuff happens  
Orik misses again, dice are shit  
dia counterspells a lightning bolt

at some point, 2 orcs are dead, the others run away and the cart is on fire. Oric Pyrotechnics away the cart fire, dia frosts a tree and allamir blows a fire away. Dia makes the ox FOCUS, GOD DAMMIT.

morning, we move on, see a dragon but avoid it and reach Phandlin. we return the ox and cart, get money from Harbin and head to bed

5 days left, we wake. we discuss business (we need a roof and a journeyman smith to get the business running). Dianthe goes to the inn. She sets a new notice about help wanted at the forge. The roof notice has a ‚ÄúYES‚Äù written on it. Toblin barely knows who were interested and who did it.  
Pete gathers info in a tavern. he hears a lighthouse treasure rumors, and pays 5 gold for beer (50 GALLONS WORTH\!\!\!). he stays there for the whole day. there are also rumors about the dragon.  
Allamir and Orik go to Adabra. There are other guests. She's happy to see us. There is an ingredient missing from the potion. Its a white flower, costal (hmm) or forest. Brewing in a day.   
Father Gabriel has good and bad new. Bad news, Night of the full moon has ot be the time. Good news, he has found assistance. Seems like the Tresendar Manor is a good place for the ritual.

Plan: dia and allamir go to the house and get the flower, orik makes a chain and manacles.

Pete gets into a Tavern brawl

The manor cellar seems to be a bit rotten, but it looks like its fine for the ritual.  
Evening. Dianthe seems to know about the flower but is a bit resistant to the idea of retrieving it (backstory). But she agrees to help. Orik will craft chains and manacles during the trip.

End of session, 4 days left come morning.

## Session 11 \- 22.06.2024

change of plans out of game, we go to the Dias old house. Orik does a shopping for chain and manacles. Allamir does owls. WE RIDE\! The smol bois in front, big lads at the back.

shit, we hear wings, probably not chicken tho. its the dragon. Orik notices that it starts to turn. immediately draws a card from the deck of illusions, it‚Äôs a fucking RED DRAGON\!\!\!  
we decide to use it as a distraction an RUN\! it seems to work, drawing the attention of the dragon. it attacks the illusion and lands for melee, but quickly realises its been BAMBOOZLED. Dia sends a boar at it to give it a snack

The dragon starts gaining on us and we make a quick left to the forrest (its far tho). it breathes on us. we get almost ded and fall off the horses. some of take some bludgeoning damage, Thunder and Lightning are dead now. we manage to make it to the cover of the forrest. Dragon takes the horses and leaves.

We regroup, find dia passed out, give her some magic *bouillon* and rations. Heals.

There is time still without the horses, only just. we keep forward, with bit of a failed survival, we find the house we‚Äôre looking for. its a slightly singed old farmhouse witha loghouse and a garden. its abandoned. dia is a bit stunned emotionally. 

at the same time, allamir fucks witht the dwarfs, baboozles them with illusory flowers, both falling for it. he finally finds some flowers tho. Pete goes around looking bushes.

Dia does a walk on the memory lane and when she returns, Orik shows her the flower, and that apparently is a trigger. Some memories, she does a magical burst of warm air. she seems a bit dazed but fine.

we stay for the nigh. Allamir sets his owl, Gnowl (its not a goblin, it is not a gnome), to sit on the roof

Night is boring.

Morning comes, 3 days left. Orik feels a weird hunger (for Petes ASS\!) and we force march back to Phandlin.

Dia remembers she has a scroll of teleportation and we quick travel back tho Phandalin by Way of Spaghetti. Allamir and Orik go to Aadabra to give her a flower.

downtime: some buy potions, Orik goes to the manor to prep the room (chain and manacles), allamir gathers food for a picnic (wine, bread and a bucket of *bouillon*)

Allamir does a prank: beer, but it tastes like water. Orik kinda loses it and almost punches allamir, but he misty steps away.

adabra brings us potion in the evening

Morning Orik almost kills allamir again, but goes to the mansion to cool off and stay away on the way there, he kills a pig and eats it in the basement.

The rest of the gang goes to the Cleric dude,. there is an elf or something there. Sister Garaele is her name.

‚ÄúMaybe in the future, I will fuck with Father and Sister‚Äù \- Aro, 2024

The gang also gets some silvered weapon in case stuff goes south.

‚ÄúWhat else is there to do?‚Äù. Pete comes to give me company. others join later.

It is time. Orik drinks the potion, goes down like a Fireball. The transformation is painful. Athletics cheks to see if Orik gets loose, which go in favor of the party. i manage to bite Pete once but i get Held Personed and muzzled and after a while Orik shed the hair and he changes back. Sister says something inweird elvish and Orik reluctantly apologizes.

Next day, Orik goes to set straight the pig matter. Turns out it was Harbins pig, but someone else took care of it. Instead of going to harbin and apologizing, he buys a pig from across the road and promises a season pass of the forge to Rikett (any tool, equipment, maintenance for free)

We start heading to the lighthouse. There is a problem, we might reach in the evening if we push but get exhausted or we risk getting caught by the dragon if we camp. we take the cao risk. at the camp site Dia makes a small wall of handsoil. to amke a camouflage camp.  
We see bones far away. Bones?

in camp Allamir tells us the story of Dildo (dragon stories). Some civ that rode dragons, a dwarf fortress filled with treasure. Some elves fighting a green dragons and it happened in this area. Some lady with dragons and attacking cities. theres a story of a boy finding and rasing a red dragon and dying in the mountains (hmm?).
