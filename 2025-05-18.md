We in the forest, sleeping, watching. Grim's watch is boring, Dia sees unthreatening blue eyes. Dia wakes up Grim, he sends Fudy on a patrol. The eyes run away (l√§hevad lahku XD). they're still there, but further.

An angry boar runs through the camp, screaming. theres a sword through the tent that is a bonus for waking us up.

The unicorn is offended and poofs away, again.

## Falconer's Lodge ##

We arrive safely and get greeted by Corwin (Ramsey)
[[NPC-s|Falcon]]  complains about the orcs, there are some half breeds with them now. Bad for business. They have attacked the Lodge too, Corwin and Falcon kills them

#Quest
There are some orcs on a hill, half a day from Falconer's. Some of them half breed. We are asked to clear them.

We decide to do a rest day and early dawn ambush. There is a risk of traps.

Pete is in the lead as we go, Allamir keeping his owl in action. we get a bit lost during the trip so we arrive later than dawn.

## The hills have henges ##
We come to a clearing with a tree in the middle. we move around it as it is extremely sus. a deer gets nabbed by a Ankheg. sucker

We reach the hill. Allamir send his owl to scout the hilltop. There is a henge at the top. There also seems to be 3 entrances into the hill and there seems to be some figures. We try to sneak close and ambush, but they spot us. A question in orcish, awnsered by a fireball applied directly do the forehead. There are twigs, orcs and Half-breeds. also a dead deer in the middle. I wonder where it came from /s. the Fireball takes out most of the twigs
