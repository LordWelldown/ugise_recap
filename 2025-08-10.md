# Session 20 #

## we in cave ##

We go caveing, but find a bedroomish thing and take a rest.
Only a room of bat guano here
the dead orcs barely have anything.

there are 2 more cave enterances.
We find a orc shitter, stench.

there is a little cell for a pig. the pig has the mark of Al Kalazor
we let the pig loose, it stays a bit.

Dia find a pearl, Lo-fi magic vibes to cast fireball to
Grim finds a shield, a bit old, but seems well made (shield +1)

last cave has a bone room, and goodie room.
theres a staff and a kinky cloak.
the staff has a ai bird head.
the cloak is a Drama Theater Prop (Cloak of Billowing)

it seems we have cleared this area, back to falconer
Sir Bacon joins the fight
Dia puts the cloack on Sir Bacon. Immediate queen

## Falconer's Lodge Again ##

safe space. We complete the quest and get rest

Falcon jagab uudised. Kuulujutud artifactist, draakoni tapmisest.
Hill of Bones??? liigume sinna.

we arrive to the hill of BONES. it is shaped like a dragon. (dragon death legend)
we arrive in the evening and look around for stuff at the hill.
Pete notices some lights at the top, near one of the BONES.

We notice that there are cracks on the ground. Grim and Pete push the bone and
topple it there are stairs down, made out of SBONE!

At the bottom, 3 lights scatter to different pathways, one leading to the wing
is dark we follow it and find 2 sarcofigy of the followers.
we decide not to grave rob, for now...

next wing, the Will-o-Wisp at a corner. Grim holds the shield and
carefully takes point. He doesn't notice the Pit Trap and falls.
Crit save to land on the shield not the rusty swords.

again, 2 sarcofigy and some murals of the party members
(wizard, cleric, figher, bard)

we head to the tail, cus the head is ofc the Hero tomb.
there is a Greatsword in a dragon skull at. we take caution
Grim also takes the sword
there is a glimmer of light in the eyes of the skull
BONES!! they start garthering
